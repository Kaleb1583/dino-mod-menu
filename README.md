# dino-mod-menu
A javascript mod menu I made for chrome://dino
So I was bored so I decided to make a mod menu for dino.

How to use:
1.chrome://dino
2 Ctrl shift I
3 copy and paste code in console
3 or click source then snippets and create a snippet and paste the code

Difference: snippets can be edited with ease if you want to edit the menu.

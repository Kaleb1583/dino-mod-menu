# dino-mod-menu
A javascript mod menu I made for chrome://dino
So I was bored so I decided to make a mod menu for dino.

How to use:
```
1.go to chrome://dino 
2 Ctrl shift I 
3 copy and paste code in console 
(or click source then snippets and create a snippet and paste the code and press ctrl+enter to run)
```
About Snippets: i use the snippet option in the chrome dev tools to code lots of things including this menu because it allows you to change the code then run it right away.

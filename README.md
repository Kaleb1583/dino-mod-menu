# dino-mod-menu
A javascript mod menu I made for chrome://dino
So I was bored so I decided to make a mod menu for dino.
theres no point to mod in dino but here you go:

How to use:
```
1.go to chrome://dino 
2 Ctrl + Shift + I 
3 copy and paste code in console 
```

    its not that good (laggy menu drag, options are able to be pressed one time/not a toggle)
    i know about it but i dont feel likes its worth fixing since it was a long time ago and who needs cheats for a simple game like dino.
